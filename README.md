### Hello!

My name is Ben Somerville. I like to write code and then chip away at it like a sculptor. Every line of code should be as clean and purposeful as the polished curve of a marble statue.

Here's a link to my responsive [music website](https://bensomerville.com) (I'm a songwriter), built from the ground up with simple Javascript.

Things I'm good at:
- Building fast web apps
    - Python (Flask)
    - Javascript
    - HTML/CSS
    - Databases/SQLAlchemy
- Data science
    - Predictive modeling (scikit-learn, tensorflow)
    - Data wrangling/engineering
    - Visualization

Things I'm learning:
- FastAPI
- AWS (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS)

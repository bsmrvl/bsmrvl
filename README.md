### Hello!

My name is Ben Somerville. I like to write code and then chip away at it like a sculptor. Every line of code should be as clean and purposeful as the polished curve of a marble statue.

I'm a recent [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com) graduate in Data Science. Before that, when the pandemic first hit, I decided to teach myself web design and built this [responsive website](https://bensomerville.com) for my music (I'm a songwriter too).  

_Things I'm good at_:
- Building fast web apps
    - Python (Flask)
    - Javascript
    - HTML/CSS
    - Databases/SQLAlchemy
- Doing stuff with data
    - Predictive modeling (scikit-learn, tensorflow)
    - Data wrangling/engineering
    - Visualization

_Things I'm learning_:
- FastAPI
- AWS
- Docker

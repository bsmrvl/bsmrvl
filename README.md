### Hello!

My name is Ben Somerville. I like to write code and then chip away at it like a sculptor. Every line of code should be as clean and purposeful as the polished curve of a marble statue.

Things I'm good at:
- Building fast web apps (with some of the below)
- Python
- Flask
- Databases/SQLAlchemy
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling (scikit-learn, tensorflow)

Things I'm learning:
- FastAPI
- AWS
